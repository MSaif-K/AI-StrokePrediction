# AI/ML-StrokePrediction

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that estimates the risk of stroke.
It trains two models (Decision Tree & Random Forest) to find patterns between patient characteristics
and stroke history by analysing a healthcare dataset that contains patient information.
The models are assessed and contrasted to determine which is more effective for forecasting the
probability of stroke.

The following were the libraries used in this project:
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- missingno
- statistics
- sklearn
